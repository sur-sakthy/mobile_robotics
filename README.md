# Mobile Robotics
This project was to build to a robot capable of communicating with a server over wifi and navigating to a specified checkpoint on a predefined track autonomously using sensors and PID controller. Additionally, the robot was able to tweet the checkpoint number it was positioned at, over a different wifi service.

The project involved design, construction, programming and testing of the robot including hardware interfaces between various components (sensors and microprocessor) in the circuit to achieve the desired functionality and teamwork to complete the project within the given time frame. The robot was programmed using a board by Texas Instruments (TI), MSP432 with a wifi shield attached (wifi CC3100 module).
Sensors used: line following sensors to detect the white line, IR distance sensor to detect the wall on the sides of the track and motors to drive the robot. The software framework used for programming was Energia IDE with a language that closely resembles C.
